# Chatbot using NLTK

This project implements a simple rule-based chatbot using Python's NLTK library. The chatbot is designed to respond to user inputs based on predefined patterns.

## Features

- Responds to various greetings, questions, and statements.
- Can carry on a simple conversation using predefined patterns and responses.
- Uses NLTK's `Chat` module and `reflections` to handle basic natural language processing tasks.
- You can extend the chatbot by adding more patterns and responses.

## Installation

1. Install the required library:

    ```bash
    pip install nltk
    ```

2. Download the NLTK resources if not already installed:

    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    ```

## How to Use

1. Import necessary modules and create a chatbot by defining patterns and reflections:

    ```python
    from nltk.chat.util import Chat, reflections
    
    pairs = [
        [r"(.*)my name is (.*)", ["Hello %2, How are you today?"]],
        [r"(.*)help(.*)", ["I can help you"]],
        [r"(.*) your name ?", ["My name is thecleverprogrammer, but you can call me robot."]],
        [r"how are you (.*)?", ["I'm doing very well", "I am great!"]],
        [r"sorry (.*)", ["It's alright", "No worries!"]],
        [r"i'm (good|well|okay|ok)", ["Glad to hear that!", "Great!"]],
        [r"(hi|hey|hello|hola)(.*)", ["Hello", "Hey there!"]],
        [r"what (.*) want?", ["Make me an offer I can't refuse!"]],
        [r"(.*)created(.*)", ["Aman Kharwal created me using NLTK in Python", "It's a secret!"]],
        [r"(.*) (location|city) ?", ["New Delhi, India"]],
        [r"(.*)raining in (.*)", ["No rain here in %2", "It might rain in %2"]],
        [r"how (.*) health (.*)", ["Health is important, but I'm a chatbot, so no worries!"]],
        [r"(.*)(sports|game|sport)(.*)", ["I love cricket!"]],
        [r"who (.*) (Cricketer|Batsman)?", ["Virat Kohli"]],
        [r"quit", ["Goodbye!", "See you soon!"]],
        [r"(.*)", ["That's interesting!"]]
    ]

    # Reflections is a dictionary that helps with pronouns swapping.
    print(reflections)
    
    # Create and start the chatbot
    chat = Chat(pairs, reflections)
    chat.converse()
    ```

2. Run the chatbot by starting a conversation:

    ```python
    chat.converse()
    ```

3. To stop the chatbot, type `quit`.

## Customization

You can add more patterns and responses to the `pairs` list. For example:

```python
pairs.append([r"(.*)favorite (food|drink)?", ["I love digital data!"]])
```
